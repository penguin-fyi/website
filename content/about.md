**P**enguin **E**nhanced **N**ative **G**NU **U**nified **I**nterface **N**ode (or **PENGUIN**) is a light-weight, general-purpose *Desktop Environment* for [Arch Linux](https://archlinux.org) and [Arch Linux ARM](https://archlinuxarm.org). It is built on [AwesomeWM](https://awesomewm.org/) and a [X](https://x.org)/[XDG](https://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Specifications/)/[GTK](https://gtk.org/)-centric software stack, and includes a small selection of applications for common computing tasks.

### Features
- **Simple Yet Flexible**  
  **PENGUIN** has all of the typical UI components—menu, tasklist, system tray, etc.—that users expect to find on a desktop, but it's also packed with plenty of features that will improve your productivity. With tiling window layouts and key-driven window management, you can quickly transition between workflows.

- **Light And Fast**  
  The minimalist design of **PENGUIN** allows it to function well on a range of devices. It's well suited for embedded systems, virtual machines, and other low-resource environments.

- **Built On Arch Linux**  
  The majority of the required packages for **PENGUIN** come from the Arch `core`, `community`, and `extra` repositories. A few packages, deemed crucial to the user experience, are sourced from the [AUR](https://aur.archlinux.org/). We do not rebuild any packages from the Arch repositories.

### Goals

World domination. :penguin::earth_americas::penguin:

### History

> Some people have told me they don't think a fat penguin really embodies the grace of Linux, which just tells me they have never seen an angry penguin charging at them in excess of 100 mph. They'd be a lot more careful about what they say if they had.
> - Linus Torvalds (1996-06-09)
